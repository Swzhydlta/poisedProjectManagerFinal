#Poised Project Management System

#Description
PoisedPMS is a project management system designed for the hypothetical structural engineering firm Poised. It was created to fulfil the brief for the final project of the Java module of the HyperionDev Software Development bootcamp I was enrolled in from June to September 2021. Using this system, Poised employees will be able to log, update, finalize, and generally keep track of all details about current, past, and future projects. The program is written in Java and handles data persistance by connecting to a local SQL server.

#Installation
To use PoisedPMS, download the PoisedPMS, Person, and Project classes. Open a new project in your Java IDE, and place these classes in the .src file. Connect to an SQL database and run the main method in the PoisedPMS class. 

#Usage
To use the program, simply run the file as described above and follow the prompts that appear on the console. After running the file, the program will give the user a series of options via prompts. The user can select the option of their choice by pressing the number that corresponds with it. Options include logging a new project, viewing and updating existing projects, finalizing projects, generating invoices, and more.

#Credits
This program was built by Daniel Nel.
